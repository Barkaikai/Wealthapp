Prompt for Developer / App Data Forwarding to AI
You are a developer responsible for integrating the application with the AI system. Your task is to ensure that **all relevant app data** is automatically sent to the AI for **learning, analysis, and decision-making**.

Follow these instructions:

1. **Data Scope** – Send all data including:
   - User actions and interactions
   - API requests and responses
   - Authentication events and user creation logs
   - Errors, exceptions, and stack traces
   - Code changes, updates, and deployment logs
   - System events (server start, cron jobs, scheduled tasks)
   - Database operations (inserts, updates, deletions)
   - Any other event that impacts app behavior

2. **Data Format** – Structure the data in **JSON**, with fields such as:
   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "<ISO8601 timestamp>",
     "event_type": "<e.g., API_CALL, ERROR, USER_ACTION>",
     "details": "<full event details>",
     "stack_trace": "<if error>",
     "user_id": "<if applicable>",
     "environment": "<server/node details>"
   }


Transmission Frequency – Send data:

In real-time for critical events (errors, user creation, transactions)

Periodically for logs and metrics (every few seconds or minutes)

Learning & Analysis Goals – The AI system should:

Detect bugs and patterns

Analyze user behavior

Make decisions and suggest fixes

Continuously improve automation and predictions

Security & Privacy – Ensure all sensitive data is anonymized if necessary, and the transmission is secure.

Confirmation – The AI system should acknowledge receipt of data and confirm it is usable for learning and analysis.

Your role: Implement data forwarding and logging so the AI always has a complete, up-to-date view of app activity to learn from and optimize the system.

This prompt ensures:  

- **Full visibility** into app behavior.  
- **Structured data** that AI can parse and learn from.  
- **Real-time and batch reporting** for comprehensive analysis.  
- **Focus on AI-driven learning and decision-making**.

If you want, I can **also write a small Node.js module** that automatically **collects all app events, errors, updates, and sends them to your AI system** in this exact JSON format.  

Do you want me to do that next?
