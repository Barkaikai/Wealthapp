## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend uses React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter, and TanStack Query. UI components are built with Shadcn/ui (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS), adhering to Material Design 3. It features a **futuristic sci-fi aesthetic** with:

**WealthForge Design System (Oct 2025 - Elite Futuristic Update):**
- **Elite Color Palette:** Primary purple (#6C1FFF), accent yellow (#FFC43D), deep space black backgrounds
- **Luxury Background Blend:** High-end villa mansion images layered beneath purple/yellow futuristic overlays with animated glow effects
- **Futuristic Typography:** 
  - Orbitron (headers, 800-900 weight, massive sizes: 3-5rem h1, 2.25-3.5rem h2)
  - Rajdhani (body text, 500 weight, 1.125rem base)
  - Purple-to-yellow gradient text on main headers
  - Purple neon glow text shadows on all headings
- **Animated Backgrounds:** Elite purple/yellow radial gradients with 10s smooth animation (eliteGlow), luxury mansion image at 15% opacity as base layer
- **Maximum Glassmorphism System (Oct 2025):**
  - 10+ specialized glass utilities: glass-card, glass-ultra, glass-light, animated-gradient, pulse-glow, holographic, cyber-glow, float, data-stream, scan-lines, fade-in
  - Enhanced dark mode transparency (rgba 0.05-0.15) for deeper glass effects
  - Cyber-glow borders (2px purple/yellow with 0-20px glow spread)
  - Continuous animations: floating (8-15s), pulsing (2-4s), holographic shimmer (3s), data-stream particles (20s)
  - All components (StatCard, HighlightCard, Quick Access cards) use glass-card base
  - Landing page features cyber-grid, scan-lines, and neon-text effects
  - **Accessibility:** Comprehensive prefers-reduced-motion safeguards disable all animations gracefully
- **Elite Loading Screen:** Instant branded splash with Orbitron font, purple-yellow gradient, pulse animation
- **Purple Neon Shadows:** Multi-layer shadows with purple glow (0-80px spread)
- **Production Domain:** wealthforge.app with CORS, CSP headers, and manifest configuration

### Technical Implementations
The backend is an Express.js with TypeScript REST API. Authentication uses Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) and Passport.js with PostgreSQL-backed sessions. PostgreSQL (Neon serverless) is the primary database, managed with Drizzle ORM. The platform supports continuous background health monitoring with diagnostic history and safe auto-fix capabilities. AI briefing generation includes robust error handling and fallback mechanisms. A PWA provides offline functionality and automatic updates. The system includes a Digital Calendar and a Terminal Interface. Performance optimizations include AI response caching (LRU, 60-min TTL), an AI request queue manager, WebSocket streaming for real-time AI responses, canonical user ID caching, structured JSON logging with rotation, AI data forwarding for learning, and Gzip compression with lazy-loaded components. Client-side caching uses IndexedDB with a DeviceStorageManager for offline resilience and performance.

**Startup & Reliability Optimizations (Oct 2025):**
- Server starts in ~1 second with instant port availability
- Background services (health monitor, automation scheduler) delayed by 2 seconds to ensure immediate server readiness
- Graceful shutdown system with proper resource cleanup (HTTP server, database connections, schedulers)
- Database connection pool with singleton initialization pattern (no duplicate connections)
- Safe garbage collection with fallback behavior when --expose-gc not available
- SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers for clean process termination

**Deployment Optimizations (Oct 2025):**
- `.dockerignore` configured to exclude node_modules (9.6GB) from Docker images
- Production build optimized to ~6MB total (4MB dist + 2MB assets) - well under 8GB limit
- Removed 12MB unnecessary images, replaced with gradient backgrounds
- Configured `.replit` with correct port mapping: localPort 5000 â†’ externalPort 80
- Real-time connection monitoring with `/api/admin/status` endpoint (30-second polling)
- Production build system with minification and error handling

**Crypto Price Aggregator (Oct 2025):**
- Multi-source cryptocurrency pricing with automatic failover (CoinPaprika, CoinCap, CryptoCompare, CoinMarketCap)
- Provider-specific identifier normalization for ~30 top cryptocurrencies
- Rate limiting (20 req/s) and caching (60s TTL) for performance
- Circuit breaker pattern for provider health monitoring
- Backward-compatible with CoinGecko API contract (ID/symbol mappings preserved)
- No API key required (CoinPaprika free tier primary source)
