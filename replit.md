## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend uses React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query. UI components are built with Shadcn/ui (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS) following Material Design 3 principles, featuring a dark-first luxury aesthetic with gold accents, Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts, mobile responsiveness, and WCAG AA compliance. A Coinbase-inspired blue theme is used, with wealth-themed background images, and a mobile/desktop view switcher.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is an Express.js with TypeScript REST API. Authentication uses Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) and Passport.js with PostgreSQL-backed sessions. PostgreSQL (Neon serverless) is the primary database, managed with Drizzle ORM. The platform supports continuous background health monitoring with diagnostic history and safe auto-fix capabilities. AI briefing generation includes robust error handling and fallback mechanisms. A PWA provides offline functionality and automatic updates. The system includes a Digital Calendar and a Terminal Interface for advanced users. Performance optimizations include:
- **AI Response Caching:** LRU cache with 1,000 item capacity, 50MB limit, 60-minute TTL, SHA256 hash-based keys for security, achieving 95%+ latency reduction for repeated queries.
- **AI Request Queue Manager:** Parallel processing up to 5 concurrent requests with 100ms aggregation window and 30-second timeout protection for stable API usage.
- **WebSocket Streaming Server:** Real-time AI response streaming at `/ws/ai-chat` with automatic cache integration, comprehensive error handling, and 80%+ perceived performance improvement.
- **Canonical User ID Caching:** LRU cache (10,000 users, 1-hour TTL) reduces database load by ~95% for active users, prevents foreign key violations across authentication providers.
- **Structured App Logging:** JSON Lines format with filesystem persistence, automatic log rotation (10MB/7-day limits), tracks all app actions, errors, and decisions for AI learning.
- **AI Data Forwarding:** Real-time and batch event forwarding to AI systems for pattern detection, user behavior analysis, and automated decision-making.
- **Gzip compression middleware** and lazy-loading of page components with React.lazy and Suspense.

### System Design Choices
The system is built for scalability and security, employing Helmet.js for HTTP headers, rate limiting, secure cookie parsing, and CSRF protection. Database schemas are designed for user-centric data with appropriate indexing. AI integration is central, providing personalized insights, recommendations, and automation across financial, lifestyle, and health domains. The Routine Builder integrates AI to generate personalized daily reports. The Digital Accountant enforces double-entry validation. The CRM integrates with the Digital Accountant for deal tracking and with the Receipt Manager for expense tracking. Receipt reports use GPT-4o to generate AI-powered insights, trends, and recommendations based on spending patterns.

- All financial routes (payments, subscriptions, wallet operations) use canonical IDs for data consistency
- Comprehensive logging system captures all app events, errors, and user actions in structured JSON format
- AI data forwarding enables continuous learning from app behavior and automated system optimization
- Log rotation ensures sustainable filesystem usage with automatic cleanup of old logs
- System monitoring endpoints provide real-time visibility into cache performance and AI data forwarding stats
