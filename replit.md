## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and data fetching

**UI Component System:**
- Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives for accessible, customizable components
- Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens following Material Design 3 principles
- Dark-first design approach with support for light mode
- Custom color palette optimized for financial data visualization (chart colors, status indicators)
- Typography system using Inter for UI/body text and JetBrains Mono for financial figures
- Path aliases configured (@/, @shared/, @assets/) for clean imports

**State Management:**
- React Query for server state with infinite stale time and disabled refetching (manual refresh pattern)
- React Hook Form with Zod validation for form state and validation
- Context API for theme management (dark/light mode switching)

**Key Design Patterns:**
- Component composition with shadcn/ui's slot pattern for flexible component variants
- Custom hooks for authentication (useAuth), toasts (useToast), and responsive design (useIsMobile)
- Separation of concerns: UI components in `/components`, page-level components in `/pages`, shared utilities in `/lib`

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework:**
- Express.js with TypeScript for the REST API
- Session-based authentication using express-session with PostgreSQL session store
- Vite middleware integration for development with HMR support

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Replit Auth integration using OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- Passport.js strategy for authentication flow
- Session management with connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL-backed sessions
- User profile stored in database with automatic upsert on login

- `events` - Financial events log (dividends, trades, statements)
- `routines` - User's daily schedule with time blocks, categories, duration
- `emails` - Synced emails with AI categorization (personal/finance/investments)
