# Wealth Automation Platform

## Overview
This AI-powered platform provides automated financial tracking, email management, daily routine optimization, and AI-driven decision support for high-net-worth individuals. It offers comprehensive wealth management, including asset aggregation, AI-powered email categorization and reply drafting, personalized daily briefings with portfolio insights, and optimized routine generation. The platform delivers an ultra-premium experience with a luxury aesthetic, integrating a double-entry Digital Accountant, CRM, health monitoring, and real-money Stripe payments for holistic life automation and financial management.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend uses React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter, and TanStack Query. UI components are built with Shadcn/ui (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS), adhering to Material Design 3. It features a dark-first luxury aesthetic with gold accents, Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts, mobile responsiveness, WCAG AA compliance, a Coinbase-inspired blue theme, wealth-themed background images, and a mobile/desktop view switcher.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is an Express.js with TypeScript REST API. Authentication uses Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) and Passport.js with PostgreSQL-backed sessions. PostgreSQL (Neon serverless) is the primary database, managed with Drizzle ORM. The platform supports continuous background health monitoring with diagnostic history and safe auto-fix capabilities. AI briefing generation includes robust error handling and fallback mechanisms. A PWA provides offline functionality and automatic updates. The system includes a Digital Calendar and a Terminal Interface. Performance optimizations include AI response caching (LRU, 60-min TTL), an AI request queue manager, WebSocket streaming for real-time AI responses, canonical user ID caching, structured JSON logging with rotation, AI data forwarding for learning, and Gzip compression with lazy-loaded components. Client-side caching uses IndexedDB with a DeviceStorageManager for offline resilience and performance.

**Startup & Reliability Optimizations (Oct 2025):**
- Server starts in ~1 second with instant port availability
- Background services (health monitor, automation scheduler) delayed by 2 seconds to ensure immediate server readiness
- Graceful shutdown system with proper resource cleanup (HTTP server, database connections, schedulers)
- Database connection pool with singleton initialization pattern (no duplicate connections)
- Safe garbage collection with fallback behavior when --expose-gc not available
- SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers for clean process termination

**Deployment Optimizations (Oct 2025):**
- `.dockerignore` configured to exclude node_modules (9.6GB) from Docker images
- Production build optimized to ~6MB total (4MB dist + 2MB assets) - well under 8GB limit
- Removed 12MB unnecessary images, replaced with gradient backgrounds
- Configured `.replit` with correct port mapping: localPort 5000 â†’ externalPort 80
- Real-time connection monitoring with `/api/admin/status` endpoint (30-second polling)
- Production build system with minification and error handling

**Crypto Price Aggregator (Oct 2025):**
- Multi-source cryptocurrency pricing with automatic failover (CoinPaprika, CoinCap, CryptoCompare, CoinMarketCap)
- Provider-specific identifier normalization for ~30 top cryptocurrencies
- Rate limiting (20 req/s) and caching (60s TTL) for performance
- Circuit breaker pattern for provider health monitoring
- Backward-compatible with CoinGecko API contract (ID/symbol mappings preserved)
- No API key required (CoinPaprika free tier primary source)
