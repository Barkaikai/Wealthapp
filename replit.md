# Wealth Automation Platform

## Overview

This is an AI-powered life automation platform designed for billionaire-level wealth management and lifestyle optimization. The application automates financial tracking, email management, daily routines, and decision-making with minimal human input. It aggregates assets across multiple platforms (stocks, crypto, bonds, real estate), uses AI to categorize and draft email replies, generates daily briefings with portfolio insights, and helps users build optimized daily routines based on successful lifestyle patterns.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System:**
- React 18 with TypeScript for type-safe component development
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
