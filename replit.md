## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend uses React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query. UI components are built with Shadcn/ui (Radix UI, Tailwind CSS) following Material Design 3 principles, featuring a dark-first luxury aesthetic with gold accents, Inter and JetBrains Mono fonts, mobile responsiveness, and WCAG AA compliance. A Coinbase-inspired blue theme (hsl 221 83% 53%) is used throughout, with wealth-themed background images. A mobile/desktop view switcher is available.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is an Express.js with TypeScript REST API. Authentication uses Replit Auth (OpenID Connect) and Passport.js with PostgreSQL-backed sessions. PostgreSQL (Neon serverless) is the primary database, managed with Drizzle ORM. The platform supports continuous background health monitoring with diagnostic history and safe auto-fix capabilities. AI briefing generation includes robust error handling and fallback mechanisms. A PWA (Progressive Web App) implementation provides offline functionality and automatic updates.
The system features a comprehensive Digital Calendar with Month/Week/Day views.
A Terminal Interface provides advanced users with system information and direct data access.

### System Design Choices
The system is built for scalability and security, employing Helmet.js for HTTP headers, rate limiting, secure cookie parsing, and CSRF protection. Database schemas are designed for user-centric data with appropriate indexing and `createdAt`/`updatedAt` timestamps. AI integration is central, providing personalized insights, recommendations, and automation across financial, lifestyle, and health domains. The Routine Builder integrates AI to generate personalized daily reports based on success leader templates. The Digital Accountant enforces double-entry validation and auto-posts journal entries for invoices and payments. The CRM integrates with the Digital Accountant for deal tracking.

### Production Readiness Status (Last Audit: October 2025)

**‚úÖ Deployment Ready (Pre-Launch Checklist Complete):**
- **Environment Validation:** Zod-based validation with production guards (terminates on missing DATABASE_URL/SESSION_SECRET in prod, dev fallbacks available)
- **Build Pipeline:** Verified working (npm run build + esbuild generates 447KB dist/index.js, npm start uses NODE_ENV=production)
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive audit passed - robust fallbacks, circuit breakers, retry logic, graceful degradation for optional services
- **Server Health:** Running on port 5000, all services configured (OpenAI, Tavily, Alpha Vantage, Stripe, Discord)
- **Monitoring:** Background health diagnostics active with auto-fix capabilities
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with 60+ indexes, optimized queries, referential integrity enforced
- **Security:** Helmet headers, rate limiting, session storage, CSRF-ready (requires CSRF_SECRET in prod)

**üìã Known Limitations (Documented in SECURITY_NOTES.md):**
- Microsoft OAuth tokens stored in session (lost on server restart, requires re-authentication)
- No automatic token refresh for Microsoft (users re-auth after ~1 hour)
- Gmail integration limited by Replit connector scopes (inbox sync unavailable)
- CSRF protection requires CSRF_SECRET environment variable
- Garbage collection auto-fix requires Node.js --expose-gc flag (cannot set in current environment)

**üîí Security Measures:**
- Helmet.js HTTP security headers
- Rate limiting on all API endpoints
- Secure session management with PostgreSQL storage
- Foreign key constraints and referential integrity enforced
- Circuit breaker patterns for external service resilience

**üöÄ Performance Optimizations:**
- 60+ database indexes on userId, foreign keys, and lookup fields
- Single-flight guards prevent concurrent operations
- Graceful degradation for optional services
- Service worker caching strategies for static assets and API responses
- Memory monitoring with automatic cleanup attempts

### Recent Security & Bug Fixes (October 4, 2025)
