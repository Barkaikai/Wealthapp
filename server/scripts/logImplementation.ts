COMPLETED:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive JSON logging system operational
- ‚úÖ Canonical user ID resolution implemented
- ‚úÖ All Wealth Forge routes use canonical IDs
- ‚úÖ API endpoints for log access created
- ‚úÖ Zero LSP errors

NEXT STEPS FOR FULL SYSTEM REFACTOR:
- 157 remaining routes still use req.user.claims.sub directly
- Recommended: Gradual migration starting with critical paths (payments, subscriptions, financial data)
- Alternative: Create middleware to auto-inject canonical ID into req.user.id for all routes
`,
